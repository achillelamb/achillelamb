### Hi there 👋


👋 I'm Achille, a passionate developer with a deep love for Rust, GNU/Linux, and blockchain technology.

🚀 My journey in the world of software engineering has led me to explore and conquer the challenges of building an EVM-based full node, a project I'm proud of.

💡 Alongside my work with Ethereum, I'm confident in my skills with the Solana blockchain, harnessing the power of both worlds to build decentralized applications that matter.

🌐 With a keen eye for performance optimization and a strong dedication to open-source principles, I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in Rust, a language I deeply appreciate.

📚 I am delving deeper into the C language and Embedded software engineering, which is why I am currently studying [Mastering STM32](https://www.carminenoviello.com/mastering-stm32/). 📟

🔗 Let's connect, learn, and build together! Feel free to reach out for collaborations, discussions, or just a friendly chat about Rust, blockchain, Linux, or embedded systems. 🌟
